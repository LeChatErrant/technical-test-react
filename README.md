## Instructions

### Task

---

If you don't know where to start, open the calculator of your smartphone.

### Must have

We will pay attention to the following points when reviewing your code:

- The code is clean and readable.
- It is possible to perform basic operations (`+` `-` `x` `/`).
- The calculator is well designed and user-friendly.

### Nice to have

For more points, feel free to pimp up the calculator. Here is a non-exhaustive list of features you could add:

- Show an history of the previous operations
- Add the possibility to use the numeric keys of your keyboard
- Add an undo/delete button
- Include an easter egg (use your creativity)

- Make the app responsive
- Include tests in your code
- Add an authentication process before accessing the calculator
